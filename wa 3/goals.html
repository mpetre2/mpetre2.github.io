   <h1>Goals</h1> 
    <p>I am committed to continuous growth academically, personally, and professionally. Academically, 
    I aim to deepen my expertise in marketing, design, and experiential branding through challenging coursework, 
    hands-on projects, and international learning opportunities. Personally, I strive to cultivate confidence, adaptability, 
    and a global perspective, drawing inspiration from my study abroad experiences. Professionally, I aspire to become a 
    creative marketing leader, gaining extensive experience in event production, brand strategy, and influencer 
    marketing while building a strong network of mentors and industry connections. My long-term vision is to lead 
    innovative campaigns and brand experiences that inspire audiences and create lasting impact.</p>
